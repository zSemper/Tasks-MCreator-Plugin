# Tasks
Tasks is an MCreator plugin designed to create a set of tasks, that can be triggered multiple times throughout the code without having to repeat it. A task variable can also store multiple tasks at once that can be individually executed by the name the task is saved under.

# Wiki
A wiki to this plugin is planned.
